# Adversarial-Image-Detection-prio-to-Melanoma-Classification

Data Source: International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive is used as data source. 

Required Python module: NumPy, SciPy, Keras, TensonFlow. GPU usage is not a mandatory. CPU can be used but it would be slow. 

cnn.py - code for classification using CNN.

acgan.py - code for adversarial image	generation 

cnn_adverse.py - CNN was applied on adversarial images.

adverse_detection.py - code for adversarial image detection.
